If you're using a comparison operator with values that are non-numeric, you need to put the value in single quotes: 'value'.

Note: SQL uses single quotes to reference column values. 

You can use >, <, and the rest of the comparison operators on non-numeric columns as wellâ€”they filter based on alphabetical order.

ARITHMETIC IN SQL 
In SQL, you can only perform arithmetic across columns on values in a given row.

You can only add values in multiple columns from the same row together using +.

if you want to add values across multiple rows, you'll need to use aggregate functions.
