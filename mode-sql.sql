/* NON-NUMERICAL DATA 
If you're using a comparison operator with values that are non-numeric, you need to put the value in single quotes: 'value'.

Note: SQL uses single quotes to reference column values. 

You can use >, <, and the rest of the comparison operators on non-numeric columns as wellâ€”they filter based on alphabetical order.
