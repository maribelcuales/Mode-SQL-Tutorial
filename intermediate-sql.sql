/* SQL AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS 
SQL is excellent at aggregating data the way you might in a pivot table in Excel.

COUNT - counts how many rows are in a particular column.
SUM - adds together all the values in a particular column.
MIN and MAX - return the lowest and highest values in a particular column, respectively.
AVG - calculates the average of a group of selected values.
*/

/* SQL COUNT 
COUNT is a SQL aggregate function for counting the number of rows in a particular column.

/* SQL SUM  
- is a SQL Aggregate function that totals the values in a given column 
- can only use on numerical columns 
- aggregators only aggregate vertically 
- If you want to perform a calculation across rows, you would do this with simple arithmetic.

/* SQL AVG 
- Calculates the average of a selected group of values.
- Can only be used on numerical columns 
- Ignores nulls completely 
- To treat null values as 0, write a statement that changes the nulls to 0

/* SQL GROUP BY
- aggregate only part of a table (e.g count the number of entries for each year) 
- allows you to separate data into groups  
*/

       COUNT(*) AS count

-- To group by multiple columns, separate column names with commasâ€”just as with ORDER BY:

 GROUP BY year, month 

-- Calculate the total number of shares traded each month. Order your results chronologically.
SELECT year,
       month,
       SUM(volume) AS volume_sum
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
 GROUP BY year, month

/* GROUP BY column numbers 
- As with ORDER BY, you can substitute numbers for column names in the GROUP BY clause.

- use this ONLY when you're grouping many columns 
*/ 
SELECT year,
       month,
       COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
 GROUP BY 1, 2 

/* GROUP BY with LIMIT 
- SQL evaluates the aggregations before the LIMIT clause. 
- If you group by a column with enough unique values that it exceeds the LIMIT number, the aggregates will be calculated, and then some rows will simply be omitted from the results.
- This is actually a nice way to do things because you know you're going to get the correct aggregates.
